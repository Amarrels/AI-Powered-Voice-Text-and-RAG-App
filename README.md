# AI-Powered-Voice-Text-and-RAG-App
AI-powered application that combines voice and text interaction with advanced features like sentiment analysis, large language model (LLM) integration, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The app allows users to dictate or listen, analyze sentiment for dynamic replies, and upload/update PDFs for interactive document-based question answering

In previous versions, I used multiple APIs (texttosppech,speechtotext) to have a working app. Now I am using one API to perform all the functionalities. 

In the new version, we are no longer doing text to speech. For now there will only be audio inputs, with genai providing the transcript and sentiment analysis in one text
